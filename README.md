Angular-Radio
=============

This is the demo app from the [jQuery Bulgaria 2013](http://www.jquerybulgaria.com/jquery2013/) session about AngularJS (blog post [here](http://abilitics.com/Blog)). 

The app is built as a demonstration of how a Single Page App can be done using AngularJS. The app can be seen in action here: http://demos.abilitics.com/angularradio

The app can:
* search iTunes for artists, albums and songs
* play songs in the background (using the [jPlayer](http://jplayer.org/) library)
* show the albums of an artist
* show the songs in an album
* favorite songs and keep the favorites in local storage
